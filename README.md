### Hello / Privet / Saluton!
  
You could find some my [publications (RU, EN) and presentations (RU)](https://github.com/Areso/presentations-publications)  from conferences, where I was a speaker.  
I like gamedev (and playing games, too), DevOps (somewhat) and Python (so far).  
/me could write some code with PHP, Golang, C and Pascal (I am somewhat old-fashioned).  
I have some background as DBA, and as a platform/cloud developer, so they are the domains, where I most effective.
