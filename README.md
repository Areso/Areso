### Hello / Privet / Saluton!
  
You could find some my [publications (RU, EN) and presentations (RU)](https://github.com/Areso/presentations-publications)  from conferences, where I was a speaker.  
I like [gamedev](https://github.com/Areso/1255-burgomaster) ([GGJ](https://github.com/Areso/mmorpg-ggj2020), [JS 13k](https://github.com/Areso/js-kiseijuu), and [so on](https://github.com/Areso/Tasogare-doki)), [DevOps](https://github.com/Areso/Webinar-ansible) (somewhat) and Python (I didn't link anything, cause my Python is so-so. But I am very passionate!).  
/me could write some code with PHP, Golang, C and Pascal (I am somewhat old-fashioned).  
I have some background as DBA, and as a [platform/cloud](https://github.com/Areso/Webinar-ansible) developer, so they are the domains, where I most effective.
